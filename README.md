atto is a tiny Nano wallet, which focuses on ease of use through
simplicity. 

Disclaimer: I am no cryptographer and atto has not been audited. I
cannot guarantee that atto is free of security compromising bugs.

# Installation
I recommend building atto yourself, but you can also
download precompiled binaries from the [releases
page](https://github.com/codesoap/atto/releases). Building atto yourself
works like this; go 1.15 or higher is required:

```shell
git clone 'https://github.com/codesoap/atto.git'
cd atto
go build
# The atto binary is now available at ./atto.
# You could also install to ~/go/bin/ by executing "go install".
```

# Usage
```console
$ # The new command generates a new seed.
$ atto new
D420296F5FEF486175FAA8F649DED00A5B0A096DB8D03972937542C51A7F296C
$ # Store it in your password manager:
$ pass insert nano
Enter password for nano: D420296F5FEF486175FAA8F649DED00A5B0A096DB8D03972937542C51A7F296C
Retype password for nano: D420296F5FEF486175FAA8F649DED00A5B0A096DB8D03972937542C51A7F296C

$ # The address command shows the address for a seed and account index.
$ pass nano | atto address

$ atto -h
Usage:
	atto n[ew]
	atto [-a ACCOUNT_INDEX] a[ddress]
	atto [-a ACCOUNT_INDEX] b[alance]
	atto [-a ACCOUNT_INDEX] r[epresentative] REPRESENTATIVE
	atto [-a ACCOUNT_INDEX] s[end] AMOUNT RECEIVER

The new subcommand generates a new seed, which can later be used with
the other subcommands.

The address, balance, representative and send subcommands will expect
a seed as as the first line of their standard input. Showing the first
address of a newly generated key could work like this:
atto new | tee seed.txt | atto address

The address subcommand displays addresses for a seed, the balance
subcommand receives pending sends and shows the balance of an account,
the representative subcommand changes the account's representative and
the send subcommand sends funds to an address.

ACCOUNT_INDEX is an optional parameter, which must be a number between 0
and 4,294,967,295. It allows you to use multiple accounts derived from
the same seed. By default the account with index 0 is chosen.
```

# Technical details
atto is written with less than 1000 lines of code and uses minimal
external dependencies. This makes it easy to audit the code yourself
and ensure, that it does nothing you wouldn't want it to do.

To change some defaults, take a look at `config.go`.

Signatures are created without the help of a node, to avoid your seed or
private keys being stolen by a node operator. Apparently this is not to
be taken for granted, since the node API offers, for example, a [method
for signing](https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/#sign) your
blocks.

atto does not have any persistance and writes nothing to your
file system. This makes atto very portable, but also means, that
no history is stored locally. I recommend using a service like
https://nanocrawler.cc/ to investigate transaction history.
